# FederalHierarchy-Crosswalk
CSV Containing a listing of federal agencies and organizations including any bureaus.

This is a superset of all agencies and bureaus contained in the NIST, OMB, and Treasury lists, as well as those defined as bureaus (and DoD commands) by the agencies themselves.

The file contains three main data elements:
* GSA-defined standard entity name (80-char max so as to be Salesforce compliant) and external key
* Names and codes as defined by NIST, OMB, and Treasury datasets
* Hierarchical relationship between entities, as defined by the agencies themselves

Feedback and edits are welcome. Check back regularly for updates. An additional 300-400 Treasury-defined bureaus will be added to the list.
